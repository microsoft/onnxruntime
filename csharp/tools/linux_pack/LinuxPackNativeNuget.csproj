<!-- csproj for use with `dotnet pack` on linux via build.py's `build_nuget` option.

     Expected usage is to create a Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime native nuget package containing only the linux
     libonnxruntime.so for local testing.
     We only enable netstandard2.0 due to that, but additional frameworks can be added as needed.

     If you need a more sophisticated package for testing, you can run the production packaging pipeline against your
     branch and download the resulting nuget package from the build artifacts.
