NOTE:

These tests no longer work as they are based on App Center's Xamarin.UITest and Xamarin is EOL.
App Center is also deprecated with EOL in 2025.

The tests need to be updated based on the App Center replacement we choose.
If that is BrowserStack, this is most likely applicable: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/dotnet/maui-samples/uitest-appium-nunit/
