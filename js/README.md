# ONNX Runtime JavaScript API

This directory contains multiple NPM projects:

- [onnxruntime-common](#onnxruntime-common)
- [onnxruntime-node](#onnxruntime-node)
- [onnxruntime-web](#onnxruntime-web)
- [onnxruntime-react-native](#onnxruntime-react-native)

## Development

This folder contains a `.vscode` folder for Visual Studio Code workspace configs. Using VSCode to open this folder
will allow code-formatting and linting features on typescript and C/C++ source code inside this folder. Following files
are used for code-formatting and linting features for developers:

- .vscode/\*\*
- package.json
- packages-lock.json
- .eslintrc.js
- .clang-format

Please follow the steps described below to setup development environment.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (14.0+): https://nodejs.org/ - (Optional) Use nvm ([Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) / [Mac/Linux](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)) to install Node.js

- Python (2.7 or 3.6+): https://www.python.org/downloads/

  - python should be added to the PATH environment variable

- Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

  - **required** extension: [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - **required** extension: [Clang-Format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format)
  - **required** extension: [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome)

- Chrome or Edge Browser

### Setup TypeScript development environment

In `<ORT_ROOT>/js`, run:

```
npm ci
```

This will install Clang-format and ESLint for code-formatting and linting features. This is a one-time setup unless a `git clean` is performed or folder `<ORT_ROOT>/js/node_modules` is removed manually.

### Using VSCode:

Use VSCode to open folder `<ORT_ROOT>/js`.

Make sure to open the correct folder to allow VSCode to load workspace configuration. Otherwise typescript and code formatter may not work as expected.

To populate typescript type declarations, in each project folder, run `npm ci`.

### Run code formatter and linter manually

In `<ORT_ROOT>/js`, use `npm run lint` to run ESLint , and use `npm run format` to run clang-format.

## onnxruntime-web

> language: typescript

> dependency: onnxruntime-common, ONNXRuntime WebAssembly

> folder: <ORT_ROOT>/js/web

This project is a library for running ONNX models on browsers. It is the successor of [ONNX.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxjs).

### Build

1. Install NPM packages

   1. in `<ORT_ROOT>/js/`, run `npm ci`.
   2. in `<ORT_ROOT>/js/common/`, run `npm ci`.
   3. in `<ORT_ROOT>/js/web/`, run `npm ci`.

2. Prepare ONNX Runtime WebAssembly artifacts.

   You can either use the prebuilt artifacts or build it by yourself.

   - Setup by script.

     In `<ORT_ROOT>/js/web/`, run `npm run pull:wasm` to pull WebAssembly artifacts for latest master branch from CI pipeline.

   - Download artifacts from pipeline manually.

     you can download prebuilt WebAssembly artifacts from [Windows WebAssembly CI Pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/onnxruntime/onnxruntime/_build?definitionId=161&_a=summary). Select a build, download artifacts "Release_ort-wasm" and "Release_ort-wasm-threaded" and unzip. See instructions below to put files into destination folders.

   - Build WebAssembly artifacts.

     1. Build ONNX Runtime WebAssembly

        ~~Follow [instructions](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/how-to/build.html#apis-and-language-bindings) for building ONNX Runtime WebAssembly. (TODO: document is not ready. we are working on it. Please see steps described as below.)~~

        in `<ORT_ROOT>/`, run one of the following commands to build WebAssembly:

        ```sh
        # In windows, use 'build' to replace './build.sh'

        # The following command build debug.
        ./build.sh --build_wasm

        # The following command build debug with debug info.
        ./build.sh --build_wasm --skip_tests --enable_wasm_debug_info

        # The following command build release.
        ./build.sh --config Release --build_wasm --skip_tests --disable_wasm_exception_catching --disable_rtti
        ```

        To build with multi-thread support, append flag `--enable_wasm_threads` to the command. To build with SIMD support, append flag `--enable_wasm_simd` to the command. Make sure to build both single-thread and multi-thread with and without SIMD before next step.

     2. Copy following files from build output folder to `<ORT_ROOT>/js/web/dist/`:

        - ort-wasm.wasm
        - ort-wasm-threaded.wasm (build with flag '--enable_wasm_threads')
        - ort-wasm-simd.wasm (build with flag '--enable_wasm_simd')
        - ort-wasm-simd-threaded.wasm (build with flags '--enable_wasm_threads --enable_wasm_simd')

     3. Copy following files from build output folder to `<ORT_ROOT>/js/web/lib/wasm/binding/`:

        - ort-wasm.js
        - ort-wasm-threaded.js (build with flag '--enable_wasm_threads')
        - ort-wasm-threaded.worker.js (build with flag '--enable_wasm_threads')

3. Use following command in folder `<ORT_ROOT>/js/web` to build:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

### Test

We use command `npm test` (test runner) and `npm run test:e2e` (E2E test) for tests in ONNXRuntime Web.

#### test runner

In folder `<ORT_ROOT>/js/web`,

- Run `npm test -- --help` for a full CLI instruction.
- Run `npm test -- <your-args> --debug` to run one or more test cases.

There are multiple levels of tests for ONNXRuntime Web:

- unit test: tests for individual components written in TypeScript. Launch unit test by:
  ```
  npm test -- unittest
  ```
- model test: run a single model. The model folder should contains one .onnx model file and one or more folders for test cases, each folder contains several input*\*.pb and output*\*.pb as test data. Launch model test by:
  ```
  npm test -- model <model_folder>
  ```
- op test: test a single operator. An op test is described in a `.jsonc` file which specify the operator type, its attributes and one or more test case(s), each includes a list of expected input tensor(s) and output tensor(s). The `.jsonc` file is located at `<ORT_ROOT>/js/web/test/data/ops`. Launch op test by:

  ```
  npm test -- op <file_name>
  ```

- suite test: suite test includes unit test, a list of model tests and op tests. Launch suite test by:
  ```
  npm test
  ```

#### E2E test

E2E test is for testing end-to-end package consuming. In this test, NPM packages for `onnxruntime-common` and `onnxruntime-web` are generated and a clean folder is used for installing packages. Then a simple mocha test is performed to make sure package can be consumed correctly.

To launch E2E test:

```
npm run test:e2e
```

### Debugging

#### Debugging TypeScript on Desktop/Chrome

To debug the code from test-runner on Chrome:

- Launch `npm test -- <your_args> --debug`. It opens an instance of Chrome browser.
- In the open Chrome browser, click the `DEBUG` button on the top-right of the page.
- In VSCode, click [side bar]->Run and Debug->select [Attach to Chrome]->click [Start Debugging] to attach.
- put breakpoints in source code, and Refresh the page to reload.

#### Debugging TypeScript on iOS/Safari

To debug on an Apple iOS device, please refer to the following steps:

- install [
  RemoteDebug iOS WebKit Adapter](https://github.com/RemoteDebug/remotedebug-ios-webkit-adapter) by following its instructions.
- launch the adapter in commandline: `remotedebug_ios_webkit_adapter --port=9000`.
- in VSCode, select debug configuration `Remote Browser via Webkit Adaptor`.
- follow the steps above to debug.

#### Debugging TypeScript on Android/Chrome

To debug on an Android device, please refer to the following steps:

- Install [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) and make sure `adb` is ready to use.
- Follow instructions in [Remote Debugging on Android](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging-legacy) to launch `adb`. Make sure to use port 9000 so that the existing debug configuration works.
- in VSCode, select debug configuration `Remote Browser via Webkit Adaptor`.
- follow the steps above to debug.

#### Debugging C/C++ for ONNX Runtime WebAssembly

To debug C/C++ code for ONNX Runtime WebAssembly, you need to build ONNX Runtime with debug info (see [Build](#Build-2)).

Currently debugging C/C++ code in WebAssembly is not supported in VSCode yet. Please follow [this instruction](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasm-debugging-2020/) to debug in browser devtool using extension [C/C++ DevTools Support (DWARF)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cc%20%20-devtools-support-dwa/pdcpmagijalfljmkmjngeonclgbbannb).

### Generating Document

Use command `npm run build:doc` to generate the latest documents.

### Distribution

It should be able to consumed by both from projects that uses NPM packages (through a Node.js folder structure of `node_modules` folder that generated by `npm install onnxruntime-web`) and from a CDN service that serves a `ort.min.js` file and one or multiple `.wasm` file(s).

## onnxruntime-react-native

> language: typescript, java, objective-c

> dependency: onnxruntime-common

> folder: <ORT_ROOT>/js/react_native

This project provides an ONNX Runtime React Native JavaScript library to run ONNX models on React Native Android and iOS app.

- A Mac computer with the latest macOS
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)

### Models with ORT format

By default, ONNX Runtime React Native leverages ONNX Runtime Mobile package with ORT format. Follow the [instruciton](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/how-to/mobile/model-conversion.html#converting-onnx-models-to-ort-format) to covert ONNX model to ORT format.

### Build

1. Install NPM packages for ONNX Runtime common JavaScript library and required React Native JavaScript libraries

   - in `<ORT_ROOT>/js/`, run `npm ci`.
   - in `<ORT_ROOT>/js/common/`, run `npm ci`.
   - in `<ORT_ROOT>/js/react_native/`, run `yarn`.

2. Build Android ONNX Runtime package

    1. To use a published Android ONNX Runtime Mobile package from Maven, go to step 5.

    2. Set up an Android build environment referring to [instruction](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/how-to/build/android-ios.html#android)

    3. In `<ORT_ROOT>`, run this python script to build ONNX Runtime Android archive file. In windows, this requires an admin account to build. To build a model specific package with reduced size, refer to [instruction](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/how-to/build/reduced.html#build-ort-with-reduced-size).

        ```sh
        python tools/ci_build/github/android/build_aar_package.py tools/ci_build/github/android/default_mobile_aar_build_settings.json --config MinSizeRel --android_sdk_path <ANDROID_SDK_PATH> --android_ndk_path <ANDROID_NDK_PATH> --build_dir <BUILD_DIRECTORY> --include_ops_by_config tools/ci_build/github/android/mobile_package.required_operators.config
        ```

    4. Copy `<BUILD_DIRECTORY>/aar_out/MinSizeRel/com/microsoft/onnxruntime/onnxruntime-mobile/<version>/onnxruntime-mobile-<version>.aar` into `<ORT_ROOT>/js/react_native/android/libs` directory.

    5. Modify `Onnxruntime_mobileVersion` property in `<ORT_ROOT>/js/react_native/android/build.properties` to consume a locally built package or a newly published package from Maven.

    6. To verify, open Android Emulator and run this command from `<ORT_ROOT>/js/react_native/android`

        ```sh
        adb shell am instrument -w ai.onnxruntime.react_native.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
        ```

3. Build iOS ONNX Runtime package

    1. To use a published c/c++ ONNX Runtime Mobile package from CocoaPods, skip all steps below.

    2. Set up iOS build environment referring to [instruction](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/how-to/build/android-ios.html#ios).

    3. Build a fat ONNX Runtime Mobile Framework for iOS and iOS simulator from `<ORT_ROOT>` using this command,

        ```sh
        python tools/ci_build/github/apple/build_ios_framework.py tools/ci_build/github/apple/default_mobile_ios_framework_build_settings.json --config MinSizeRel --include_ops_by_config tools/ci_build/github/android/mobile_package.required_operators.config
        ```

        It creates `onnxruntime.framework` in `build/iOS_framework/framework_out` directory. Create an archive file of `onnxruntime.framework` directory as follows and copy to `<ORT_ROOT>/js/react_native/local_pods` directory.

        ```sh
        zip -r onnxruntime-mobile-c.zip onnxruntime.framework
        ```

    4. To verify, open iOS Simulator and run this command from `<ORT_ROOT>/js/react_native/ios`. Change a destination to specify a running iOS Simulator.

        ```sh
        pod install
        xcodebuild test -workspace OnnxruntimeModule.xcworkspace -scheme OnnxruntimeModuleTest -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 11,OS=14.5'
        ```

4. Test an example for Android and iOS. In Windows, open Android Emulator first.

   `debug.keystore` must be generated ahead for Android example.

    ```sh
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore <ORT_ROOT>/js/react_native/example/android/app/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 999999 -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"
    ```

    From `<ORT_ROOT>/js/react_native,

    ```sh
    yarn bootstrap
    yarn example ios
    yarn example android
    ```

### NPM Packaging

1. Update a version using `npm verison <version>` from `<ORT_ROOT>/js/react_native` folder. If it's for a dev, use `npm version <version>-dev.<subversion>`

2. Modify Onnxruntime_mobileVersion property in `<ORT_ROOT>/js/react_native/android/build.properties` to update ONNX Runtime Android package version.

3. Run `yarn prepack` to change `onnxruntime-common` to point to a published npm package

4. Run `npm pack` and verify NPM package contents

5. Run `npm publish <tgz> --dry-run` to see how it's going to be published

6. Run `npm publish <tgz>` to publish to npmjs. If it's for a dev, add flag `--tag dev`.

### Distribution

It should be able to consumed by React Native projects that uses Yarn packages through `yarn add onnxruntime-react-native`.
