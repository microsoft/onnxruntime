# Welcome to ONNX Runtime!

**ONNX Runtime** is a cross-platform **inferencing and training accelerator** compatible with popular ML/DNN frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, and more.

You can benefit from ONNX Runtime if you want to:

* Improve inference performance for a wide variety of ML models
* Reduce time and cost of training large models
* Train in Python but deploy into a C#/C++/Java app
* Run on different hardware and operating systems
* Train and perform inference with models created in different frameworks

[ONNX Runtime inferencing](/docs/api) APIs are stable and production-ready since the [1.0 release](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/tag/v1.0.0) in October 2019 and can enable faster customer experiences and lower costs.

[ONNX Runtime training](/docs/training) feature was introduced in May 2020 in preview. This feature supports acceleration of PyTorch training on multi-node NVIDIA GPUs for transformer models. Additional updates for this feature are coming soon.
