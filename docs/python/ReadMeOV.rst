OpenVINO™ Execution Provider for ONNX Runtime
===============================================

`OpenVINO™ Execution Provider for ONNX Runtime <https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/OpenVINO-ExecutionProvider.html>`_ is a product designed for ONNX Runtime developers who want to get started with OpenVINO™ in their inferencing applications. This product delivers  `OpenVINO™ <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit.html>`_ inline optimizations which enhance inferencing performance with minimal code modifications. 

OpenVINO™ Execution Provider for ONNX Runtime accelerates inference across many  `AI models <https://github.com/onnx/models>`_ on a variety of Intel® hardware such as:
 - Intel® CPUs
 - Intel® integrated GPUs
 - Intel® Movidius™ Vision Processing Units - referred to as VPU.


Installation
------------

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, RHEL(CPU only) or Windows 10 - 64 bit
- Python 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 for Linux and only Python3.9 for Windows

This package supports:
 - Intel® CPUs
 - Intel® integrated GPUs
 - Intel® Movidius™ Vision Processing Units (VPUs).

Please Note for VAD-M use Docker installation / Build from Source for Linux. 

``pip3 install onnxruntime-openvino==1.12.0``

Please install OpenVINO™ PyPi Package separately for Windows. 
For installation instructions on Windows please refer to  `OpenVINO™ Execution Provider for ONNX Runtime for Windows <https://github.com/intel/onnxruntime/releases/>`_.

**OpenVINO™ Execution Provider for ONNX Runtime** Linux Wheels comes with pre-built libraries of OpenVINO™ version 2022.1.0 eliminating the need to install OpenVINO™ separately. The OpenVINO™ libraries are prebuilt with CXX11_ABI flag set to 0.

The package also includes module that is used by torch-ort-inference to accelerate inference for PyTorch models with OpenVINO Execution Provider. 
See `torch-ort-inference <https://github.com/pytorch/ort#accelerate-inference-for-pytorch-models-with-onnx-runtime-preview>`_ for more details.

For more details on build and installation please refer to `Build <https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/eps.html#openvino>`_.

Usage
^^^^^

By default, Intel® CPU is used to run inference. However, you can change the default option to either Intel® integrated GPU or Intel® VPU for AI inferencing.
Invoke `the provider config device type argument <https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/OpenVINO-ExecutionProvider.html#summary-of-options>`_ to change the hardware on which inferencing is done.

For more API calls and environment variables, see  `Usage <https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/OpenVINO-ExecutionProvider.html#configuration-options>`_.
