# PackedSparseAttentionIndexer — Operator Documentation

This document describes the `com.microsoft::PackedSparseAttentionIndexer` contrib operator: the
packed/variable-length counterpart of `com.microsoft::SparseAttentionIndexer`, built for
continuous-batching (paged) inference engines such as an OgaEngine-style `PagedAttention` model.

## 1. Why a separate operator

`SparseAttentionIndexer` uses dense `[batch_size, sequence_length, ...]` tensors, an explicit dense
QSA visibility mask, and state that grows by concatenation every call
(`present_key = concat(past_key, key)`, etc.). A continuous-batching / paged engine instead:

- flattens every request's tokens into one `[total_tokens, ...]` axis (packed layout);
- schedules a different number of new tokens per request per step;
- keeps every request's KV/indexer state in a **fixed-address, fixed-capacity** slot of a state
  pool (so the engine can reuse buffers and support CUDA graph capture), never a tensor that grows;
- derives causal visibility purely from packed offsets, never from a materialized `[B, S, T]` mask.

Restructuring `SparseAttentionIndexer` in place to support both contracts was judged more invasive
and risky than the value of the shared line count (roughly 25-35% of the dense implementation is
directly reusable without change; most of the rest needs new shapes, new state semantics, or a
different launch/index mapping). `PackedSparseAttentionIndexer` is therefore a new op, version 1,
that **does not change `SparseAttentionIndexer`'s schema or behavior**. See [§8](#8-what-is-shared-vs-packed-specific).

## 2. Operator schema

Attributes:

| Attribute | Constraint | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `policy_mode` | required, `"qsa"` or `"csa"` | selects the indexer flavour |
| `compress_ratio` | required, `> 0` | tokens folded into one block/compressed entry |
| `state_capacity` | required, `> 0` | fixed capacity (entries) of `past_key_state` |
| `token_budget` | `qsa` only, `> 0`, divisible by `compress_ratio` | selected-token budget |
| `index_topk` | `csa` only, `> 0` | selected compressed-entry count |
| `epsilon` | default `1e-6` | RMSNorm epsilon |
| `scale` | default `1/sqrt(head_size)` | per-head score scale |
| `head_weight_scale` | `csa` only, default `1/sqrt(num_heads)` | head-weight score scale |

Inputs are **fixed at 16 indices** for both policies (unlike the dense op, which uses a different
input/output count per policy). A slot not owned by the active policy is a *positional* optional:
its `NodeProto` input name is empty rather than the slot being removed from the list, so every
later slot keeps its fixed index.

| # | Name | Shape | Type | Policy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `query` | `(total_tokens, num_heads*head_size)` | T | both |
| 1 | `key` | `(total_tokens, head_size)` qsa / `(total_tokens, 2*head_size)` csa | T | both |
| 2 | `query_norm_weight` | `(head_size)` | T | both |
| 3 | `key_norm_weight` | `(head_size)` | T | both |
| 4 | `cos_cache` | `(max_position, rotary_width)` or `(batch_size, max_position, rotary_width)` | T | both |
| 5 | `sin_cache` | same shape as `cos_cache` | T | both |
| 6 | `cumulative_sequence_lengths` | `(batch_size + 1)` | int32, device-resident | both |
| 7 | `past_sequence_lengths` | `(batch_size)` | int32, device-resident | both |
| 8 | `gate` | `(total_tokens, 2*head_size)` | T | csa only |
| 9 | `position_bias` | `(compress_ratio, 2*head_size)` | T | csa only |
| 10 | `head_weights` | `(total_tokens, num_heads)` | T | csa only |
| 11 | `position_ids` | `(total_tokens)` | int64 | optional qsa / required csa |
| 12 | `past_key_state` | `(batch_size, state_capacity, head_size)` | T | both (generic) |
| 13 | `past_kv_buffer` | `(batch_size, 2*compress_ratio-1, width)` | T | both (generic) |
| 14 | `past_gate_buffer` | same shape as `past_kv_buffer` | T | csa only |
| 15 | `past_state_lengths` | `(batch_size, 2)` | int32, device-resident | both (generic) |

Outputs are **fixed at 6 indices** for both policies (`present_gate_buffer` is declared with an
empty output name for `qsa`, the same positional-optional convention as above):

| # | Name | Shape | Type | Policy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `selected_indices` | `(total_tokens, capacity)` | int32 | both |
| 1 | `selected_counts` | `(total_tokens)` | int32 | both |
| 2 | `present_key_state` | same shape as `past_key_state` | T | both |
| 3 | `present_kv_buffer` | same shape as `past_kv_buffer` | T | both |
| 4 | `present_gate_buffer` | same shape as `past_gate_buffer` | T | csa only |
| 5 | `present_state_lengths` | same shape as `past_state_lengths` | int32 | both |

`capacity` is `token_budget + compress_ratio - 1` for `qsa` and `index_topk` for `csa`, exactly the
same formula (`SelectedCapacity`) used by `SparseAttentionIndexer`.

**No output shape depends on tensor data.** `total_tokens` and `batch_size` come from input
*shapes* (`query.shape[0]`, `cumulative_sequence_lengths.shape[0] - 1`); every state output has
exactly the same shape as its corresponding state input. This is what makes the fixed-capacity
state design load-bearing: a growing/concatenated state (as in the dense op) would require a
data-dependent output shape, which is incompatible with CUDA graph capture and with pre-allocated
paged state pools.

## 3. Generic state, shared by both policies

Both policies read and write the *same four* state slots — there is no separate
`past_compressed_key` vs. `past_key` naming split as in the dense op:

- `past_key_state` / `present_key_state`: `qsa` stores prepared (already mean-pooled, RMSNorm'd and
  rotated) complete-block keys; `csa` stores compressed keys. Layout-compatible with, or cheaply
  reshaped to, a `[batch_size, capacity, 1, head_size]` auxiliary paged cache when K = V.
- `past_kv_buffer` / `present_kv_buffer` (and `past_gate_buffer` / `present_gate_buffer`, `csa`
  only): the generic pending-token buffer, fixed capacity `2 * compress_ratio - 1`. `qsa` only ever
  uses up to `compress_ratio - 1` of these entries (a raw, not-yet-pooled block); `csa` uses the
  full range for the overlap ("Ca") plus leftover ("Cb") halves of the window-plan arithmetic
  reused from `SparseAttentionIndexer`.
- `past_state_lengths` / `present_state_lengths`: `(batch_size, 2)`. Column 0 is the `key_state`
  entry count (`qsa`: complete-block count; `csa`: compressed-entry count); column 1 is the pending
  buffer length (`qsa`: incomplete-block length in `[0, compress_ratio)`; `csa`: buffer length in
  `[0, 2 * compress_ratio)`, exactly the invariant already documented for
  `CsaWindowPlan`/`TryComputeCsaWindowPlan`).

State never grows. `present_*` always has exactly the same shape as `past_*`; only the *contents*
change. Input/output aliasing is supported. CUDA avoids unsafe buffer aliases; WebGPU omits an
aliased `past_*` read-only binding and reads the prior contents through the matching read-write
`present_*` binding. Each request is handled by one invocation, and buffer compaction reads entries
at or above the destination index before overwriting them.

**State overflow.** If a call would close more blocks/windows than
`state_capacity - old_entry_count` allows, that request's step is rejected as a deterministic
no-op: its state and state lengths remain unchanged, and its selection outputs stay empty. This
never reads or writes outside a tensor's fixed extent and never silently truncates state.

## 4. Packed metadata and device-side safety

`cumulative_sequence_lengths` and `past_sequence_lengths` are **device-resident** tensors, read
directly by the kernels — never copied to the host or synchronized on. The device-visible
invariants (validated by well-behaved callers; a malformed value never causes memory corruption,
see below) are:

- `cumulative_sequence_lengths[0] == 0`;
- `cumulative_sequence_lengths[batch_size] == total_tokens`;
- `cumulative_sequence_lengths` is nondecreasing (a repeated offset — a zero-token request row —
  is valid and simply contributes no query rows for that request);
- `past_sequence_lengths[b] >= 0` and, for `qsa`, consistent with `past_state_lengths[b]`
  (`key_state_length == past_sequence_length / compress_ratio`,
  `buffer_length == past_sequence_length % compress_ratio`);
- `past_state_lengths[b, 0] <= state_capacity` and `past_state_lengths[b, 1]` within its policy's
  valid buffer range.

Because there is no host synchronization, the kernels cannot literally raise a C++ exception when
one of these invariants is violated by the input data (as opposed to a mismatched tensor *shape*,
which the host-side `OpKernel::Compute` and the ONNX schema still check the ordinary way). Instead,
every per-request quantity read from these tensors is **clamped into its valid range before use**
(`old_key_len = clamp(past_state_lengths[b,0], 0, state_capacity)`, etc.), and the request-token
lookup (`PackedBatchOfToken`, a binary search over `cumulative_sequence_lengths`) always returns an
index in `[0, batch_size)`. The result is that malformed metadata can make the numeric result wrong
for the affected request, but it can never read or write outside a tensor's allocated extent and
never causes overlapping writes between requests. This mirrors the "prefer deterministic safe
outputs" guidance for EPs that cannot report device-side validation errors asynchronously.

## 5. Policy `qsa`

Each request's packed token range is processed independently, in the same three stages as the
dense `qsa` policy but against fixed-capacity state instead of a growing cache:

1. **Update** (one launch per request): append each raw indexer key to the generic pending buffer;
   whenever it reaches `compress_ratio` tokens, mean-pool it, apply RMSNorm and `key_norm_weight`,
   apply the leading/split-half rotary convention at the block's first logical token position
   (`entry * compress_ratio`, where `entry` is the block's absolute index in `key_state`), and
   append the **prepared** (already normalized and rotated) key to `key_state`. This differs from
   the dense kernel, which stores *raw* concatenated keys and repeats the pooling/RMSNorm/rotate
   work for every query; storing the prepared key once, at update time, is possible only because
   packed `key_state` never needs to be re-windowed the way a dense-mask query can.
2. **Score** (one launch per query token, per candidate block): every causally visible block
   (`block index < min(key_state_length, causal_threshold(position))`) is scored directly against
   `key_state` with `sum_h ReLU(q_h . k)` — a single dot product, no recomputation.
3. **Select** (one launch per query token): keeps the `token_budget / compress_ratio` highest
   scoring blocks (ties broken by ascending index) and appends the request-local logical token
   positions `[j * compress_ratio, ..., j * compress_ratio + compress_ratio - 1]` for each selected
   block `j`, followed by every causally visible position of the current incomplete block, and
   writes the exact active count to `selected_counts`.

"Request-local logical token position" means the same numbering as
`past_sequence_lengths[b] + local_offset` — i.e. the request's own absolute token position, which
is exactly what a per-request main paged KV cache is addressed by. The output is therefore directly
consumable by `SparsePagedAttention` configured with `attention_mode="selected_only"`,
`selected_kv_source="main"`.

## 6. Policy `csa`

Reuses `SparseAttentionIndexer`'s CSA compression, rotary, scoring, causal threshold, and
deterministic TopK semantics verbatim (the *math* is unchanged); only the layout, state, and launch
mapping are packed:

1. **Update** (one launch per request): computes the window plan
   (`overlap_length`, `leftover_length`, `new_window_count`, `present_buffer_length`,
   `present_buffer_start`) for that request's own `buffer_length` and packed token count using
   `TryComputeCsaWindowPlan` — the exact same function used by `SparseAttentionIndexer`'s schema
   and kernel, called directly on the device (it is a small `SAI_HOST_DEVICE` inline function with
   no CUDA-specific code). Every closed window is compressed with the softmax-gated Ca/Cb pooling,
   normalized, rotated with the trailing convention, and appended to `key_state`; the request
   rejects (caps) new windows beyond `state_capacity` as described in [§3](#3-generic-state-shared-by-both-policies).
2. **Score** (one launch per query token, per compressed entry): every entry is scored with
   `sum_h w_h * ReLU(q_h . k)` and masked by the causal threshold from `position_ids` (required for
   `csa`, unlike `qsa` where it is an optional override of the default `past_sequence_length +
   local offset`).
3. **Select** (one launch per query token): keeps the `index_topk` highest scoring, causally
   visible entries and writes the exact active count to `selected_counts`.

`selected_indices` values are compressed-entry indices into `key_state`, consumable by
`SparsePagedAttention` configured with `attention_mode="local_plus_selected"`,
`selected_kv_source="auxiliary"`; `key_state` is layout-compatible with, or cheaply reshaped to, the
auxiliary cache contract (`[batch_size, capacity, 1, head_size]` when K = V).

## 7. Provider support

CUDA and WebGPU both implement version 1 of this operator, for `float32`, `float16` (CUDA also
`bfloat16`). There is intentionally no CPU kernel (only the shared constants/helpers/schema are
CPU-agnostic); a production model that uses this op targets a paged-KV engine on an accelerator.
See [the WebGPU note](webgpu/packed_sparse_attention_indexer.md) for WebGPU-specific details.

## 8. What is shared vs. packed-specific

Shared with `SparseAttentionIndexer`, unmodified:

- `Policy` enum, `TryParsePolicy`, `SelectedCapacity` (selected-capacity formula) — from
  `sparse_attention_indexer_common.h`;
- `CsaWindowPlan` / `TryComputeCsaWindowPlan` (CSA window-plan arithmetic) — same header, now
  additionally annotated `SAI_HOST_DEVICE` so CUDA device code can call it directly;
- the CUDA device math (`sparse_attention_indexer_device_math.cuh`, newly extracted from
  `sparse_attention_indexer_impl.cu` with no behavior change): FP32 block reductions
  (`SaiBlockSum`), deterministic argmax/selection (`SaiBlockArgMax`, `SaiScanForNext`), the leading
  and trailing RoPE conventions (`SaiLeadingRope`, `SaiTrailingRope`), and the causal-threshold
  formula (`SaiCausalThreshold`, which turns out to be exactly the "number of complete blocks fully
  visible to a query" formula needed by both policies here, unifying what the dense implementation
  computed two different ways).

Deliberately **not** shared (packed-specific mechanics with no dense equivalent, or dense-only
mechanics with no packed equivalent):

- packed metadata validation and the device-side per-token/per-request lookup
  (`PackedBatchOfToken`);
- fully in-place fixed-capacity state update (no growing/concatenating state, no host-visible
  data-dependent output shape);
- plain causal visibility derived from packed offsets (no dense `[B, 1, S, T]` mask input, no
  mask-compaction step);
- the dense op's batch-major `[B, S, ...]` launch/index mapping and host wrappers, which do not
  apply to a token-major `[total_tokens, ...]` tensor.

## 9. Testing

`onnxruntime/test/contrib_ops/packed_sparse_attention_indexer_op_test.cc` covers:

- shape inference for `qsa` and `csa` (fixed `selected_indices`/`selected_counts` shapes, fixed
  state output shapes, the strict per-slot policy validation, and the always-6-outputs contract);
- multi-request packed batches with unequal token counts, a zero-token request row, and prefill
  followed by decode with independent per-request state (CUDA/WebGPU, skipped without the
  respective execution provider);
- `qsa` state-capacity overflow safety;
- FP32/FP16 (and CUDA-only BF16) numeric coverage against an in-file reference that mirrors this
  document's contract.

## 10. Known limitations and follow-ups

- The reference CUDA/WebGPU kernels prioritize correctness over throughput (see the top-of-file
  comments in the `.cu`/`.cc` implementations). CUDA QSA fuses query rotation into scoring and
  uses a single-read deterministic block TopK for up to 32 selected blocks; larger TopK values
  retain the correctness-first repeated-scan fallback.
- OgaEngine / Model Builder integration (declaring `past_key_state` etc. as Engine-managed,
  per-request fixed-size state, analogous to a paged auxiliary cache) is out of scope for this
  operator definition and is expected in a follow-up to `microsoft/onnxruntime-genai`.
- No CPU kernel is provided.
