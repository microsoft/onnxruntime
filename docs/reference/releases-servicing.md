# Releases and servicing
Official releases of ONNX Runtime are managed by the core ONNX Runtime team and packages are published roughly quarterly.

Releases are versioned according to [Versioning](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/faxu-doc-updates/docs/Versioning.md) and release branches are prefixed with "rel-". Patch releases may be published periodically between full releases and will have their own  release branch.
