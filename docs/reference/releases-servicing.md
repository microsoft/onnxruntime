# ONNX Runtime releases

The current ONNX Runtime release is [1.13](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/tag/v1.13.1).

The next release is ONNX Runtime release 1.14.

Official releases of ONNX Runtime are managed by the core ONNX Runtime team. A new release is published approximately every quarter.
