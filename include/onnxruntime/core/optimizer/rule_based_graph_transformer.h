/**
@class RuleBasedGraphTransformer

Rule-based graph transformer that provides an API to register rewrite rules 
and an API to apply all applicable rules to a Graph.

Represents an IGraphTransformer determined by a set of rewrite rules.
The transformer will apply all the rewrite rules iteratively as determined by the underlying rewriting strategy.
Several rewriting-strategies are possible when traversing the graph and applying rewrite rules, 
each with different trade offs. At the moment, we define one that performs top-down traversal of nodes.

@TODO: Is a bottom-up traversal more efficient?
@TODO: Is it worth adding the max number of passes a rule should be applied for?
@TODO: We need to define a contract about whether a rewrite rule is allowed to leave
       the graph in an inconsistent state (this will determine when and where we will be
       calling Graph::resolve().
