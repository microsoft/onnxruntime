// ORT thread pool overview
// ------------------------
//
// The ORT thread pool implementation is split into two layers.  This
// file provides the high-level component.  See the accompanying
// comments in EigenNonBlockingThreadPool.h for the low-level
// component.
//
// threadpool.h defines the user-facing functions for use in
// operators.  The main abstraction are parallel loops
// (ThreadPool::TryParallelFor*), although we also support scheduling
// of asynchronous tasks (ThreadPool::Schedule), and the construction
// of multi-loop parallel sections (ThreadPool::ParallelSection).
//
// This high level API is accessed via static methods on the
// ThreadPool class.  These methods map the operations onto one of
// three low-level implementations: (#1) direct execution of the
// operations if there is no thread pool configured, (#2) execution of
// the operations using the modified Eigen threadpool, (#3) execution
// of the operations using OpenMP.  Option #1 enables execution in
// simple settings without needing threads.  Option #2 is the
// preferred approach for use in settings with parallelism.
//
// The high-level part of the thread pool is responsible for:
//
// - Exposing the desired degree of parallelism to user code, and to
//   libraries such as MLAS.  This lets the libraries tailor the
//   extent to which they parallelize work.
//
// - Handling trivial cases (such as directly running parallel loops
//   with only a single iteration, or with no iterations at all).
//
// - Deciding how to divide work efficiently between the threads
//   available.
//
//   The ThreadPool::TryParallelFor methods do this based on cost
//   estimates supplied by the caller, and are designed to support
//   loops with small amounts of work per iteration.  The loop body is
//   supplied as a function taking a [start,end) range of iterations
//   to execute (avoiding the need for per-iteration std::function
//   calls, or a reliance upon inlining to avoid those calls).
//
//   ThreadPool::TrySimpleParallelFor uses a simpler single-iteration
//   API based on the assumption that the caller has divided work to
//   an appropriate granularity.
//
// - When used with the Eigen-based thread pool, the implementation of
//   all of the loops maps down onto
//   ThreadPool::ParallelForFixedBlockSizeScheduling.  This method
//   takes the degree of parallelism (d_of_p) and work distribution
//   block size (from the cost-based heuristics), and creates a set of
//   tasks in the underlying thread pool (via
//   ThreadPool::RunInParallel).
//
//   These tasks then run a loop which picks off batches of iterations
//   from the user's code.  The distribution of these batches is
//   handled dynmamically via LoopCounter::ClaimIterations.  This
//   dynamic balancing behavior helps make performance robust to any
//   variability in the execution time across iterations, and to
//   situations such as multiple loops running concurrently on the
//   same thread pool.
//
// - When running a series of loops inside a parallel section, the
//   LoopCounter also helps obtain affinity between these loops (i.e.,
//   iteration X of one loop will tend to run on the same thread that
//   ran iteration X of prior loops).  This locality helps improve hit
//   rates in per-core caches across the series of short loops used in
//   operators like GRU.
//
// There are some known areas for exploration here:
//
// - The cost-based heuristics were developed prior to recent changes
//   to the thread pool.  The heuristics seem to work well, but we
//   should revisit the tuning periodically.
//
// - Can we unify the APIs for the different kinds of parallel loop?
//
//   In particular, we may be able to replace the current use of
//   TryBatchParallelFor with appropriate costs for each call site,
//   and then use TryParallelFor.  This would allow for more dynamic
//   re-balancing of work between threads than the current
//   ThreadPool::PartitionWork function provides.
//
// - Given the extensive modifications to original Eigen code, should
//   we separate that out as a new class and remove the dependence on
//   other Eigen components.

  // affinity between corresponding iterations of different loops.
  //
  // Multi-loop sections would typically be used in cases where a
  // series of loops executes without much code in between them, and
  // where it is impractical to refactor code into a single loop.  For
  // instance:

  // of parallel sections.
