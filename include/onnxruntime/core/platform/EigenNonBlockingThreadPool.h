// ORT thread pool overview
// ------------------------
//
// The ORT thread pool implementation is split into two layers.  This
// file provides the low-level component.  See the accompanying
// comments in threadpool.h for the high-level component.
//
// The code here is derived from the Eigen non-blocking thread pool,
// although many parts have been updated over time.  The main
// abstractions used here are:
//
// - The thread pool maintains a set of OS threads running
//   ThreadPoolTempl::WorkerLoop.
//
//   Each thread has its own RunQueue object, holding a queue of tasks
//   that have been pushed to the thread for execution.  The main work
//   loop is to pop a task from the head of the queue, and to execute
//   it to completion.  If the worker's run queue is empty then it
//   will spin waiting for work, then attempt to steal tasks from
//   other threads' queues, and then block in the OS if it cannot find
//   work.
//
//   This spin-then-block behavior is configured via a flag provided
//   when creating the thread pool, and by the constant spin_count.
//
// - Although all tasks are simple void()->void functions,
//   conceptually there are three different kinds:
//
//   - One-shot tasks submitted externally via the Schedule() method.
//     These tasks are used to support asynchronous work.  These are
//     used in the parallel executor, but otherwise are not widely
//     used outside of test harnesses (see threadpool_test.cc for some
//     examples).
//
//   - Tasks for running a parallel loop.
//
//     The tasks themselves are defined in threadpool.cc, and are
//     submitted to the run queues via RunInParallel->SummonWorkers.
//     Each task will loop internally, picking off iterations from the
//     user's code via atoic-fetch-and-add, until the loop is
//     complete.
//
//     This two-layer approach lets us separate out the
//     super-lightweight per-iteration-batch work from the more
//     costly per-loop work of managing Task objects.
//
//   - Tasks for running a parallel section.  This is an extension of
//     the approach taken for parallel loops.  However, the Tasks are
//     defined in this file, and can pick up iterations from a series
//     of different parallel loops.  The tasks are defined in
//     RunInParallelSection->SummonWorkers.
//
//     The additional layer of parallel sections is a further way to
//     amortize costs: the work done creating the tasks can be
//     performed once, and then exploited over a series of loops.
//
// There are a few aspects of the modified Eigen thread pool to
// highlight:
//
// - The run queues follow the usual approach of having push/pop
//   operations on the front/back, and optimizing the PopFront case
//   for single-threaded use by the thread owning the run queue.
//   Two points to note here are:
//
//   * We should experiment with simplifying these queues.  In ORT, we
//     use the CAS-based scheduling layer in threadpool.cc for the
//     fine-grained allocation of individual loop iterations to worker
//     threads.  This means we do not have the form of recursive
//     sub-division of work that motivates the original design.
//
//   * We support an additional Revoke operation to replace an item in
//     the middle of a queue with a tombstone.  This operation is used
//     at the end of parallel loops and parallel sections to remove
//     any tasks that were created but not yet executed.  Once
//     revoked, a thread can rely on the fact that the task will no
//     longer execute.  Revocation helps manage captured state in
//     parallel loops: the alternatives would be (i) waiting for all
//     tasks that captured state to reach the head of their queues and
//     execute, or (ii) use heap-allocated state in tasks, and use a
//     technique such as reference counting to de-allocate it.
//
//     To support revocation, each thread has a unique "Tag" to
//     identify the items that it adds to the work queues.  A thread
//     can revoke an item only if it has the thread's own tag.
//
// - When entering a parallel loop (or parallel section), a thread
//   maintains a set of "preferred" worker hints, and initially
//   submits tasks to these workers.  
//   When a task executes, it updates the submitting thread's
//   preferred workers to reflect the worker that the task ran on.
//   Hence, if a task is submitted to thread T1's queue, and then
//   stolen by T2 for execution, then T2 will become preferred.
//
//   This "stickiness" aims to retain locality between successive
//   loops submitted by the same thread, to maintain the same set of
//   active threads over time (when the entire pool is not needed),
//   and to allow concurrent requests to submit works to their own
//   respective sets of preferred workers.

// Preferred workers
// -----------------
//
// Initialize the set of hints for preferred worker threads we will
// use.  We do this once, covering the maximum num_threads_ items,
// in order to avoid resizing preferred_workers concurrent with
// access from worker threads.
//
// For simplicity we initialize with hints round-robin among the
// workers.  For simple workloads with 1 main thread this means we
// will distribute work across the pool of workers.  For workers
// with multiple main threads it attempts to balance the load.
//
// These hints are just used as a starting point, and are updated by
// the worker thread that actually claims an item (e.g., if an item
// initially assigned to thread T1 is stolen and executed by T2,
// then T2 is assigned at the new preferred worker).
//
// Note that the hints are held in the _main_ thread that submits
// work to the pool.  We assume that a thread is primarily
// submitting work to just one pool, but allow for the pool to
// change over time.  Hence we allow the hints vector to grow over
// time.
//
// A note on terminology used in the variable names here:
//
// dop - degree of parallelism, as seen by the user.  For instance
//       dop=4 means 4 threads in total: 1 main thread that enters the
//       loop, plus 1 dispatcher thread, plus 2 additional worker
//       threads.
//
// par_idx - a thread's index within the loop, in the range [0,dop).
//
// num_threads_ - the number of worker threads in the thread pool.  A
//       loop with dop=4 will be common on a pool with 3 threads
//       (given that the main thread will also participate).
//
// q_idx - a worker queue index, in the range [0,num_threads_).
//
// preferred_workers - this maps from par_idx values to q_idx.  Hence,
//        with dop=4 the vector will have length 4, and will identify
//        which of the workers (0,1,2) should run tasks for the loop.
//        Note that mapping from par_idx values means that only slots
//        [1,dop) are actually used in preferred_workers.
//
// Here are three examples, all assuming a machine with 4 h/w threads,
// and ORT configured to use dop=4.
//
// * First, suppose that a single job is running a series of loops.
//   Its main thread enters a parallel loop.  Initially, let's assume
//   its preferred worker array is [_,0,1,2], writing "_" for the
//   unusued element for the par_idx=0 work that the main thread will
//   run.
//
//   The main thread schedules the dispatcher task onto worker 0.
//
//   The dispatcher task schedules worker tasks onto workers 1 and 2.
//
//   The tasks all execute, without any work stealing, on the threads
//   they were scheduled on.  The preferred worker array remains
//   [_,0,1,2].
//
// * Next, assume we have the same job, and for whatever reason the
//   preferred workers were initially [_,0,0,0].
//
//   The main thread schedules the dispatcher onto worker 0.
//
//   This dispatcher task runs on worker 0, and pushes the worker
//   tasks back onto worker 0's queue.
//
//   Workers 1 and 2 are idle, and steal tasks from worker 0.  As the
//   tasks run, they update the preferred_workers array to record the
//   workers that execute them.
//
//   After the loop, the preferred worker array may now be [_,0,2,1]
//   or [_,0,1,2], reflecting the fact that the work has got
//   re-distributed.  The next loop will start out by distributing the
//   work to those same workers.
//
// * Finally, let's assume we have two jobs running on two main
//   threads, and we are now using DoP=2 in the loops, and have 2
//   workers in the thread pool (so the machine is not
//   over-subscribed).
//
//   Each main thread has its own preferred_workers, and
//   let's say initially these are both [_,0].
//
//   Here, with DoP=2, each main thread will just dispatch a single
//   task immediately (there is no need for asynchrony with only one
//   task to generate).
//
//   Initially both main threads will submit these tasks to worker 0.
//
//   Once worker 1 steals one of these tasks, the task will update its
//   preferred worker to be 1.
//
//   From that point onwards, the two main threads will dispatch tasks
//   to separate workers, avoiding the need for further work stealing.
