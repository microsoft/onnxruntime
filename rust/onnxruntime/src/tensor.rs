//! Module containing tensor types.
//!
//! Two main types of tensors are available.
//!
//! The first one, [`Tensor`](struct.Tensor.html),
//! is an _owned_ tensor that is backed by [`ndarray`](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray).
//! This kind of tensor is used to pass input data for the inference.
//!
//! The second one, [`OrtOwnedTensor`](struct.OrtOwnedTensor.html), is used
//! internally to pass to the ONNX Runtime inference execution to place
//! its output values. It is built using a [`OrtOwnedTensorExtractor`](struct.OrtOwnedTensorExtractor.html)
//! following the builder pattern.
//!
//! Once "extracted" from the runtime environment, this tensor will contain an
//! [`ndarray::ArrayView`](https://docs.rs/ndarray/latest/ndarray/type.ArrayView.html)
//! containing _a view_ of the data. When going out of scope, this tensor will free the required
//! memory on the C side.
//!
//! **NOTE**: Tensors are not meant to be built directly. When performing inference,
//! the [`Session::run()`](../session/struct.Session.html#method.run) method takes
//! an `ndarray::Array` as input (taking ownership of it) and will convert it internally
//! to a [`Tensor`](struct.Tensor.html). After inference, a [`OrtOwnedTensor`](struct.OrtOwnedTensor.html)
//! will be returned by the method which can be derefed into its internal
//! [`ndarray::ArrayView`](https://docs.rs/ndarray/latest/ndarray/type.ArrayView.html).
