prepare_cherry_picks.py

Generates commit SHAs and PR descriptions for cherry-picking GitHub PRs tagged with a specific release label.

üõ† Requirements:
- Python 3
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- A file named 'already_picked.txt' containing PR numbers already cherry-picked (one per line)

üì¶ What it does:
1. Fetches all PRs from `main` tagged with the specified label (e.g. `release:1.22.0`)
2. Filters out already cherry-picked PRs using `already_picked.txt`
3. Outputs:
   - `cherry_pick_list.txt`: Commit SHAs and PR titles (for reference)
   - `cherry_pick_shas.txt`: Raw list of SHAs for scripting or manual use
   - `cherry_pick_pr_description.md`: PR-ready markdown summary of cherry-picked PRs

üìã Usage:
$ python3 prepare_cherry_picks.py
