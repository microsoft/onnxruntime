|ai.onnx:Clip||
|ai.onnx:Concat||
|ai.onnx:Conv|Only 1D/2D Conv is supported.<br/>Bias if provided must be constant.|
|ai.onnx:ConvTranspose|Weight and bias must be constant.<br/>padding_type of SAME_UPPER/SAME_LOWER is not supported.<br/>kernel_shape must have default values.<br/>output_shape is not supported.<br/>output_padding must have default values.|
