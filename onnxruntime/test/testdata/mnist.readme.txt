The mnist model is used in multiple tests for minimal/mobile builds in both ONNX and ORT formats.

We also save both ONNX and ORT format versions of the model with level 1 (aka 'basic') optimizations applied.
  - mnist.level1_opt.onnx makes sure the required operators for this model are automatically included in 
    required_ops.config, which is used in the reduced ops CI build.
  - mnist.level1_opt.ort is used in NNAPI unit tests.
