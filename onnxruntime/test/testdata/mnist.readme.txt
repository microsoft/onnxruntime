The mnist model is used in multiple tests for minimal/mobile builds in both ONNX and ORT formats.

We also save both ONNX and ORT format versions of the model with level 1 (aka 'basic') optimizations applied.
  - mnist.level1_opt.onnx makes sure the required operators for this model are automatically included in 
    required_ops.config, which is used in the reduced ops CI build.
  - mnist.level1_opt.ort is used in NNAPI unit tests.

The level 1 optimized model files can be generated by running the following command from the repo root and renaming the
resulting .onnx and .ort files accordingly:
  $ python ./tools/python/convert_onnx_models_to_ort.py --optimization_level basic --save_optimized_onnx_model ./onnxruntime/test/testdata/mnist.onnx
