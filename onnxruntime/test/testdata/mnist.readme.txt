The mnist model is used in multiple tests for minimal/mobile builds in both ONNX and ORT formats.

We also save both ONNX and ORT format versions of the model with level 1 (aka 'basic') optimizations applied.
  - mnist.level1_opt.onnx makes sure the required operators for this model are automatically included in 
    required_ops.config, which is used in the reduced ops CI build.
  - mnist.level1_opt.ort is used in NNAPI unit tests.

The level 1 optimized model files can be generated with the following steps:
- Set environment variable ORT_CONVERT_ONNX_MODELS_TO_ORT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL=basic
- From this directory, run
  $ python -m onnxruntime.tools.convert_onnx_models_to_ort --optimization_style=Fixed --save_optimized_onnx_model ./mnist.onnx
- Rename the resulting .onnx and .ort files accordingly
