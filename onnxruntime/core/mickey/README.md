# About Mickey

Playful name for a template library of high performance cuda code that
are often shared by various AI operators. The intention is to make this
header files only, with no binary impact unless it is instantiated
where it is needed.

Currently cuda code are scattered in multiple locations in the repo.
Hopefully this can be the starting point of consolidating all cuda
code.
