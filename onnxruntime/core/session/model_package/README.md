# Model Package Format

This document describes the model package directory layout and the JSON files used by ONNX Runtime to discover and load model packages. All JSON files must be UTF-8 encoded.

## Definitions

- Model Package

  - A model package defines the overall logical ‘model’
  - A model package contains one or more ‘component models’
  - The component models are executed when running the model package to provide the overall functionality of the logical model
  - A model package may contain configuration information to support running multiple component models

- Component Model
  - A component model comprises one or more ‘model variants’
  - All variants have the same model inputs and outputs with the same shapes.
    - The data types may vary.

- Model Variant
  - A ‘model variant’ is a single ONNX or ORT format model.

## Notes:
- Only one component model is allowed in the package for now, but the format allows for multiple component models in the future.
- If it's an ORT GenAI model variant, the variant directory contains all GenAI files. ORT GenAI used as-is.
- Shared weights is not yet supported, but the format allows for it in the future.

## `manifest.json` (required)

Location: `<package_root>/manifest.json`

Purpose: Provides the overall package identity and (optionally) lists component models available in the package.

Schema:
- `model_name` (string, required): Logical package name.
- `component_models` (object, optional): Map of component model names to their descriptors.
  - `<component_model_name>` (object, required if present):
    - `model_variants` (object, optional): Map of variant names to variant descriptors.
      - `<variant_name>` (object, required if present):
        - `model_type` (string, optional): Type of the model (e.g., `"onnx"`, `"ORT-GenAI"`). If omitted, ORT will treat it as an ONNX model by default.
        - `file` (string, optional): Path relative to the component model directory. Can point to an ONNX model file or a directory. If it is a directory, or if `file` is omitted, ORT will discover the ONNX model file within that directory.
        - `constraints` (object, required):
          - `ep` (string, required): Execution provider name (e.g., `"TensorrtExecutionProvider"`, `"QNNExecutionProvider"`, `"OpenVINOExecutionProvider"`).
          - `device` (string, optional): Target device type (e.g., `"cpu"`, `"gpu"`, `"npu"`). Must match a supported `OrtHardwareDevice`. If the EPContext model can support multiple device types, this field can be omitted and EP should record supported device types in `ep_compatibility_info` instead.
          - `architecture` (string, optional): Hardware architecture hint; interpreted by the EP if needed.
          - `ep_compatibility_info` (string, optional): EP-specific compatibility string (as produced by `OrtEp::GetCompiledModelCompatibilityInfo()`); validated by the EP when selecting a variant. **The compatibility value returned by the EP is critical—ORT uses it to rank and choose the model variant.**

Notes:
- `component_models` may be omitted. In that case, ORT will discover component models and rely on each component model’s `metadata.json` to enumerate variants.
- If `component_models` is present but a given component omits `model_variants`, its variants must be defined in that component’s `metadata.json`.
- All file paths are relative to the component model’s directory unless stated otherwise.
- Only one component model is allowed in the package for now.

### `manifest.json` examples

**Minimal with no component list (metadata.json drives discovery):**
```json
{
    "model_name":  <logical_model_name>
}
```


**Multiple variants with differing constraints:**
```json
{
    "model_name":  <logical_model_name>,
    "component_models": {
        <model_name_1>: {
            "model_variants": {
                <variant_1>: {
                    "model_type": "onnx",
                    "file": "model_ctx.onnx",
                    "constraints": {
                        "ep": "TensorrtExecutionProvider",
                        "ep_compatibility_info": "device=gpu,npu;cuda_driver_version_support=..."
                    }
                },
                <variant_2>: {
                    "model_type": "onnx",
                    "file": "model_ctx.onnx",
                    "constraints": {
                        "ep": "OpenVINOExecutionProvider",
                        "device": "cpu",
                        "ep_compatibility_info": "device=cpu;hardware_architecture=panther_lake;..."
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        <model_name_2>: { … }
    }
}
```


## `metadata.json` (required per component model)

Location: `<package_root>/models/<component_model>/metadata.json`

Purpose: Describes the variants available for a specific component model.

Schema:
- `component_model_name` (string, required): Name of the component model.
- `model_variants` (object, required): Map of variant names to variant descriptors.
  - `<variant_name>` (object, required):
    - `model_type` (string, optional): Type of the model (e.g., `"onnx"`, `"ORT-GenAI"`). If omitted, ORT will treat it as an ONNX model by default.
    - `file` (string, optional): Path relative to the component model directory. Can point to an ONNX model file or a directory. If it is a directory, or if `file` is omitted, ORT will discover the ONNX model file within that directory.
    - `constraints` (object, required):
      - `ep` (string, required): Execution provider name.
      - `device` (string, optional): Target device type (e.g., `"cpu"`, `"gpu"`, `"npu"`). Must match a supported `OrtHardwareDevice`. If the EPContext model can support multiple device types, this field can be omitted and EP should record supported device types in `ep_compatibility_info` instead.
      - `architecture` (string, optional): Hardware architecture hint.
      - `ep_compatibility_info` (string, optional): EP-specific compatibility string (as produced by `OrtEp::GetCompiledModelCompatibilityInfo()`); validated by the EP when selecting a variant. **The compatibility value returned by the EP is critical—ORT uses it to rank and choose the model variant.**

### `metadata.json` example
```json
{
    "component_model_name":  <component_model_name>,
    "model_variants": {
        <variant_1>: {
            "model_type": "onnx",
            "file": "model_ctx.onnx",
            "constraints": {
                "ep": "TensorrtExecutionProvider",
                "ep_compatibility_info": "device=gpu,npu;cuda_driver_version_support=..."
            }
        },
        <variant_2>: {
            "model_type": "onnx",
            "file": "model_ctx.onnx",
             "constraints": {
                 "ep": "OpenVINOExecutionProvider",
                 "device": "cpu",
                 "ep_compatibility_info": "device=cpu;hardware_architecture=panther_lake;..."
             }
        }
    }
}
```


## Processing rules (runtime expectations)

- ONNX Runtime reads `manifest.json` first to enumerate component models and any declared variants.
- For each component model, `metadata.json` supplies the definitive list of variants and constraints.
- Variant selection is performed by matching constraints (EP, device, `ep_compatibility_info`, and optionally architecture). **The EP’s returned compatibility value (e.g., `EP_SUPPORTED_OPTIMAL`, `EP_SUPPORTED_PREFER_RECOMPILATION`) is used to score and pick the winning model variant.**
- All file paths must be relative to the component model directory; avoid absolute paths to keep packages portable
