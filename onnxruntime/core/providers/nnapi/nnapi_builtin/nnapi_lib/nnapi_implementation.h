   * Get the NNAPI runtime feature level.
   *
   * Since API level 31 (NNAPI feature level 5), the NNAPI runtime
   * (libneuralnetworks.so) and its API specification can be updated between
   * Android API releases.
   *
   * On Android devices with API level 31 and newer, for NNAPI runtime feature
   * discovery, the NNAPI runtime feature level must be used instead of the
   * Android device API level.
   *
   * On Android devices with API level 30 and older, the Android API level of
   * the Android device must be used for NNAPI runtime feature discovery. Enum
   * values in
   * {@link FeatureLevelCode} from feature level 1 to 5 have their corresponding
   * Android API levels listed in their documentation, and each such enum value
   * equals the corresponding API level. This allows using the Android API level
   * as the feature level. This mapping between enum value and Android API level
   * does not exist for feature levels after NNAPI feature level 5 and API
   * levels after S (31).
   *
   * Example usage:
   * int device_api_level = android_get_device_api_level();
   * int64_t runtime_feature_level = (device_api_level < __ANDROID_API_S__) ?
   *                                  device_api_level :
   * ANeuralNetworks_getRuntimeFeatureLevel();
   *
   * Runtime feature level is closely related to NNAPI device feature level
   * ({@link ANeuralNetworksDevice_getFeatureLevel}), which indicates an NNAPI
   * device feature level (the most advanced NNAPI specification and features
   * that the driver implements). This function expresses NNAPI runtime feature
   * level, which indicates the most advanced NNAPI specification and features
   * the runtime implements. An NNAPI device feature level is always less than
   * or equal to the runtime feature level.
   *
   * This function returns a {@link FeatureLevelCode} enum value,
   * which is the NNAPI specification version that this NNAPI runtime
   * implements. It is NOT an Android API level.
   *
   * Available since NNAPI feature level 5.
