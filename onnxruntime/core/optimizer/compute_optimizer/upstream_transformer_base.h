 * @brief Graph transformer base that helps reduce compute FLOP while maintaining mathematically equivalent results.

 * unnecessary computations on the graph level.
 *
 * Currently, the major optimization is to bring some slice operators ahead as much as possible, to leave more ops
 * operate on sliced input data. Gather and GatherND are the entry operators that trigger the optimization search.
 *
 * T1 defines the operator info type that is used to store the information of the operator to propagate.
 * T2 defines the base operator actor type that is used to support the pass-through.
