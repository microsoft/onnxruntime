/* Runtime optimization limitations
 *
 * A runtime optimization cannot optimize a node which was created by another runtime optimization.
 *
 * This constraint is believed to be acceptable now because:
 * - Runtime optimizations are expected to be limited to replaying certain extended-level optimizations that fuse ONNX
 *   nodes into contrib op nodes.
 *   - Thus, they should not be handling any nodes that are produced by other runtime optimizations.
 * - Layout optimizations are expected to run directly in a minimal build instead of being replayed with runtime
 *   optimizations.
 *
 * If this constraint needs to be lifted at some point, note these considerations:
 * 1. Nodes produced by runtime optimizations need to be tracked more carefully when loading the runtime optimizations.
 *    The current approach is to identify nodes by their indices. A node's index in the graph depends on when the node
 *    gets added to the graph. The ordering of node additions when saving runtime optimizations may be different from
 *    the ordering when loading them. There needs to be a way to refer to the same runtime optimization-produced node
 *    at save and load time.
 * 2. There is an intermediate state between a runtime optimization and a later runtime optimization that depends on a
 *    node produced by the first. The ORT format model should contain the initial (not intermediate) graph state plus
 *    the runtime optimizations. There needs to be a way to make the result of a runtime optimization visible to later
 *    runtime optimizations and also save the initial graph state.
