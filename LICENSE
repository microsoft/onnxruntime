MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

ONNX RUNTIME (PREVIEW)

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation 
(or one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any 
Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such services 
or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those 
different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s 
rights relating to pre-updated software or services).

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. 
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

a) General. You may install and use any number of copies of the software 
on your devices, solely to demonstrate and internally evaluate it for 
your internal business purposes. You may not use the software in a 
live operating environment unless Microsoft permits you to do so under 
another agreement.

b) Third Party Software. The software may include third party applications 
that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. 
Any included notices for third party applications are for your information only.

2. PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. The software is a pre-release version. It may not 
operate correctly. It may be different from the commercially released version.

3. FEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, 
you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and 
commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will 
not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft 
to license its software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft 
includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.

4. DATA COLLECTION. This software may interact with other Microsoft products 
that collect data that is transmitted to Microsoft. To learn more about 
how Microsoft processes personal data we collect, please see the 
Microsoft Privacy Statement at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248681.

5. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves 
all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this 
limitation, you will not (and have no right to):

a) work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow 
you to use it in certain ways;

b) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software;

c) modify source code that may be included with the software;

d) remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or 
its suppliers in the software;

e) use the software for commercial, non-profit, or revenue-generating activities;

f) use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or 
propagate malware; or

g) share, publish, distribute, or lend the software, provide the software 
as a stand-alone hosted solution for others to use, or transfer the software 
or this agreement to any third party.

6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international 
export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include 
restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information 
on export restrictions, visit http://aka.ms/exporting.

7. SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide 
any support services for the software. Any support provided is “as is”,
“with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind.

8. UPDATES. The software may periodically check for updates, and download 
and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or 
authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system
to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates 
without any additional notice. Updates may not include or support all existing 
software features, services, or peripheral devices.

9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide 
for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement 
for the software.

10. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software 
in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live 
(or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern
the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims 
(including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless 
of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any other country, 
its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent 
to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, 
Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent 
to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, 
Washington for all disputes heard in court.

11. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain 
legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under 
the laws of your state, province, or country. Separate and apart from your 
relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the 
party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change 
those other rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not 
permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the
below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions 
apply to you:

a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer 
Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.

b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving 
updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your
device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, 
however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates),
or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also 
specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.

c) Germany and Austria.

i. Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as 
described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. 
However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the 
licensed software.

ii. Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, 
claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or 
personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.

Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight
negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,
the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, 
the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the 
compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal 
obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not 
be liable for slight negligence.

12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE 
RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, 
OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, 
MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

13. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR 
RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, 
YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP 
TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, 
LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; 
and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; 
strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case 
to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the 
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply 
to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion 
or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.

Please note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses 
in this agreement are provided below in French.

Remarque: Ce logiciel étant distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses dans
ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.

EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ».
Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. 
Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier
de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des 
consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises 
par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation
à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.

LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES.
Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en 
cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez 
prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les 
dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices.

Cette limitation concerne:

- tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) 
figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers; et

- les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de 
responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée
par la loi en vigueur.

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître 
l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou 
la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou
de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion 
ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.

EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. 
Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. 
Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois 
de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
